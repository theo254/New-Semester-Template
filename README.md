# New-Semester-Template-For-Windows
Creates a skeleton structure of folders to use for organizing class materials for the next semester.
This only works within a Windows Environment and was created to run specifically for Windows 10
## Instructions
### Running the Program
This script will be avaiable to run once the project has been downloaded to the computer, the folder has been extracted, and the file "New_Semester_Template.exe" is double clicked on. Only run this script once.
### Information Entry
Once the program has began running, it will as questions regrading your classes next semester. The program will ask how many classes are being taken as well as the name of those classes.
After this information is entered, the program will begin creating the folders, and the system will notify you of every folder made.
The new folder will be named "Texas State University" and will be located in the Documents directory in File Explorer.

### Disclaimer
Only run this script once to avoid duplication.
During the creation process, no files or folders will be deleted, only added. This will prevent any possible data loss.
Once the creation process begins, a notification prompt will appear for every folder creation due to the script being encapsulated and running like a .exe file. This is more of a inconvience than anything actually being wrong. To easily bypass this barrage of notifications, you can hold down the Enter button.
